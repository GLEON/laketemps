Description: This package includes access to lake temperature records, metadata, and climate drivers for 291 global lakes 
1985-2009. Temperature observations were collected using satellite and in situ methods. Climatic drivers and geomorphometric 
characteristics were also compiled and are included for each lake. Data are part of the associated publication from the 
Global Lake Temperature Collaboration project (http://www.laketemperature.org). See citation('laketemps') for dataset attribution.
